# ShipStation Order Splitting

This app is a Node.js / Express.js that creates a simple API to receive a new order webhook from ShipStation.  Upon the receipt of a new order, this app will analyze the order to determine if it is necessary to split the order based on the invidual line item's warehouse location.  If a split is necsarry, the app will create new copies of the order in shipstation, one for each product's warehouse location.
